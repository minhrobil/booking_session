## ðŸš€ If Given More Time, I Would Improve

- Add **trainer management** to prevent overlapping schedules for the same trainer (currently not managed).
- Send emails **asynchronously** to improve booking API performance.
- Implement **user and booking management system** to support multi-user access and tracking.
